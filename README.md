# synrxnforge

**synrxnforge** is a lightweight Python package to generate *synthetic chemical reactions* from a retrosynthetic SMARTS template and a pool of molecules.

It applies reaction templates in reverse (retrosynthetic mode) to product molecules, generating synthetic reaction SMILES datasets â€” optionally tagged for downstream ML tasks.

Great for creating high volumes of reactions of a given reactivity, should be coupled with some kind of downstream validation process to ensure chemical validity of created reactions. (see *synrxnval*)
